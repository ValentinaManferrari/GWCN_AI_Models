### Dataset Folder
Contains the .csv files used for the project. You can find the full database on Kaggle [1]

### ClimateChangeCode.ipynb 
This notebook contains all the Python code used to implement Time Series Forcasting models and show graphic representations of data and future predictions.

### ClimateChangeInterface.html
This is a basic blog-style graphic interface where AI model forcasting results are explained and shown visually.
