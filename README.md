# GWCN_AI_Models

### Mission and objectives

Since 3rd November, 2011, ASCOA has been dedicated to improving the awareness of the local community on HIV/AIDS and its related stigma, promoting peace building in the society, fostering environmental protection and the fight against climate change, supporting children, and empowering women and girls in order to improve their socio-economic participation and boost their wellbeing. We envision a world free of HIV/AIDS, where people are neither stigmatized nor discriminated upon due to their HIV status; a world where women are empowered and children are protected; a world where peace reigns and people live in an environment free of pollution and global warming.

### Context
Developing AI models related to health and environment using Python language and implementing these models as interactive web applications on a website built with WordPress.

### Task description
Subjects chosen: "TBD1" and "TBD2". 
The work on each subject is supposed to take 6 weeks.
For each of these subjects, I will look for relevant datasets, namely on Kaggle, to build AI models upon.
Once a dataset is approved, I will build an AI algorithm using either Python programming language and the Pythonâ€™s Flask platform to translate the subject into a code that can be displayed through an interactive web application on a website built with WordPress.
